### as very basic funcions, mock and simulate where needed to go fast
- [x] login
- [x] create game, 
- [x] examples scenario
- [x] copy invite
- [x] one player joins
- [ ] facilitator start day
- [x] scenario as tabular data
- [ ] first day with an event that changes a world attribute
- [ ] a fast forward event
